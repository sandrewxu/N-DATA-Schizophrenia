# N-DATA-Schizophrenia

Pipeline for using the novel N-DATA method (https://github.com/JustinaXie/NDATA) on a dataset curated for Schizophrenia. Can easily be used for any other disease as well. 
A necessary file, "De_novo_mutations_and_annotations_in_coding_region_1.2.txt", was too large to add. It can be found at http://www.genemed.tech/gene4denovo/download.
